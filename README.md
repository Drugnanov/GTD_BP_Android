## Building

The build requires [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/downloads)
v2.10+ and the [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
to be installed in your development environment. In addition you'll need to set
the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to the location of your SDK:

    export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/your/android-sdk

After satisfying those requirements, the build is pretty simple:

* Run `gradlew` or `gradle assembleDebug` or `gradle assembleRelease` from the `app` directory to build the APK only
* Run one of the commands above from the root directory to build the app and also run
  the integration tests, this requires a connected Android device or running
  emulator.


## Acknowledgements

GTD project is created as BP school project on ČVUT FIT.

As its based on Bootstrap layout i am using same extensions. Plus using Facebook and Google API for connections.
If you want tu run you local instance you will need also GTD_BP(https://github.com/Drugnanov/GTD_BP).
Its backend REST Api part for persist data.
Gtd is built on the awesome [Parse.com API](http://www.parse.com/)
and uses many great open-source libraries from the Android dev community:

* [AppCompat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TGgYqfJnyc) for a
  consistent, great looking header across all Android platforms,
  [ViewPagerIndicator](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator)
  for swiping between fragments and
  [NineOldAndroids](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) for
  view animations - all from [Jake Wharton](http://jakewharton.com/).
* [NavigationDrawer](http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation-drawer.html) for the menu drawer navigation.
* [Dagger](https://github.com/square/dagger) for dependency-injection.
* [ButterKnife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) for view injection
* [Otto](https://github.com/square/otto) as the event bus
* [Robotium](http://code.google.com/p/robotium/)
  for driving our app during integration tests.
* [android-maven-plugin](https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin)
  for automating our build and producing release-ready APKs.
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) for interacting with
  remote HTTP resources (API's in this case).
* [google-gson](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) for consuming JSON and hydrating
  POJO's for use in the app.
* [facebook SKD](https://developers.facebook.com/) for able to sign in user and obtain his access token.
* [google play services](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/) for able to sign in user and obtain his access token.

Application also requires Facebook and Google play services be installed on you mobile devices.

I hope this helps you in building your next android app.
